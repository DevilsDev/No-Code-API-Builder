These connectors will be made available within the platform, allowing users to easily integrate their APIs with external services such as **Stripe**, **SendGrid**, and **Dropbox**. The availability of these connectors will significantly reduce the time required to integrate and operationalize third-party services, helping users accelerate their development timelines.

6. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Implementation of security measures to enable users to manage permissions and access rights for team members. This feature will allow administrators to assign different roles, such as developer, tester, or viewer, to various team members. Each role will have specific permissions to ensure that users only access the areas of the platform relevant to their work. This granular control over permissions helps in maintaining security and accountability, particularly when multiple users collaborate on a single project.

7. **Template Library**: Availability of pre-built API templates for common use cases, allowing users to initiate projects without the need to start from scratch. The template library will include use cases such as user authentication, payment processing, data syncing, and more. These templates will act as a foundation, enabling users to easily customize and extend them based on their unique requirements, thereby accelerating the development process and providing a quicker route to deployment.

8. **User Authentication and Authorization**: Platform security facilitated through robust user authentication mechanisms, such as **OAuth** and **JWT**-based sessions. The implementation will ensure that users can securely log in, manage sessions, and protect their API endpoints. Security protocols will be aligned with industry standards to safeguard user data and maintain the confidentiality and integrity of API transactions. Advanced features like multi-factor authentication (MFA) will also be considered to enhance the security of sensitive operations.

9. **Support and Documentation**: Creation of onboarding guides, interactive tutorials, FAQs, and a comprehensive help center to assist new users. The support ecosystem will be designed to accommodate users of varying technical expertise, with resources that guide them through the process of building and deploying their first API. In addition, video tutorials and in-app guidance tools will be included to provide a richer, more engaging learning experience, allowing users to become proficient with the platform's features more quickly.

## Out-of-Scope Items
The following elements are **excluded** from the project and are not part of the current development phase:

1. **Custom Backend Integrations**: Development of customized backend logic beyond the functionalities provided by the API builder and pre-built connectors. Any specialized server-side logic that requires in-depth customization will need to be developed externally, as this phase focuses on using the existing modular components.

2. **Mobile Application**: The development of a native mobile application for API creation or management is not included in this phase. Users will access and interact with the platform through a web interface optimized for desktop environments, with responsive elements to allow limited functionality on mobile devices.

3. **On-Premises Deployment**: The solution will be exclusively cloud-based, with no on-premises deployment capabilities. Given the reliance on AWS services for serverless deployments, the platform will not support environments requiring private infrastructure, ensuring a focus on scalability and cloud reliability.

4. **Advanced Analytics Dashboard**: In-depth analytics features beyond basic usage metrics will not be incorporated within the initial scope. While basic metrics such as API request counts and error rates will be available, more complex analytics—such as trend analysis, predictive insights, and detailed data visualizations—will be deferred to future phases.

5. **Custom UI Themes**: Users will not have the ability to create entirely custom UI themes or extensively modify the user interface beyond minor adjustments, such as color schemes and branding. The focus will remain on delivering a consistent and cohesive user experience across the platform.

6. **Consulting Services**: Direct consulting services or personalized one-on-one user guidance are excluded. Support will be confined to written documentation, tutorials, and community-driven forums. Users seeking in-depth, individualized support will need to explore external consulting options.

## Assumptions
- The project presupposes that users will have access to a stable internet connection and possess a foundational understanding of cloud-based systems. The platform is designed to be accessible to those without deep technical knowledge, but familiarity with basic cloud and internet operations will be beneficial for optimal use.
- The integration of third-party services is restricted to those explicitly supported by the provided pre-built connectors. Any additional service integrations will require either the addition of new connectors in subsequent phases or custom development by the user.

## Constraints
- The development timeline is capped at **6 months**, encompassing key milestones such as Minimum Viable Product (MVP) development, beta testing, and the final deployment. Each milestone will have defined deliverables to ensure that the project remains on track, and any delays in one phase may impact subsequent deadlines.
- The project budget does not accommodate extensive customization requests beyond the set of features outlined in this document. Any additional features requested by stakeholders during development will require re-evaluation of the budget and timeline to assess feasibility.

## Conclusion
This **Scope Definition** aims to clearly establish the boundaries of the **No-Code API Builder** project. By outlining both inclusions and exclusions, this document facilitates effective expectation management, supports strategic decision-making, and ensures alignment among all team members and stakeholders. Moreover, it serves as a reference throughout the project's lifecycle to mitigate scope creep and maintain focus on the project's core objectives. Ensuring that stakeholders are aligned on what is—and what is not—part of the project allows the development team to work more effectively and avoid unnecessary revisions or additions that could disrupt timelines or budgets.

The **No-Code API Builder** project seeks to empower users by providing an accessible, streamlined platform for creating APIs, thereby fostering innovation, increasing productivity, and enabling a broader audience to take advantage of the capabilities of API-driven development. As the project progresses through its development phases, maintaining a clear, well-communicated scope will be critical to the platform's ultimate success, helping all involved parties to stay focused on delivering a solution that meets user needs and achieves the intended value proposition.
